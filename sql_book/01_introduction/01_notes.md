# Introduction

## Terminology

* **Unstructured data**: Data that contains information without any structure, such as content inside emails or books or images.
* **Structured data**: Tables and spreadsheets allow us to find the data easily and also to manage it better. A common way of storing structured data is using a relational database.
* **Database**: 'a structured set of data held in a computer'
* **Relational database**: Database organized according to the relational model of data. The relational model defines a set of relations (which we can think of as analogous to tables) and describes the relationships, or connections, between them in order to determine how the data stored in them can interact.
* **Relational Database Management Systems**: Software application, or system, for managing relational databases. An RDBMS allows a user, or another application, to interact with a database by issuing commands using syntax that conforms to a certain set of conventions or standards (SQL). (Not all databases use a relational model. MongoDB, for instance, uses the document-oriented data storage model. These an other models are grouped under 'NoSQL').
* **SQL**: Stands for Structured Query Language. The programming language used to communicate with a relational database.
  * Allows you to Select (find), Insert (add), Update (change), and Delete (remove) a large amount of data.
  * SQL is a declarative language; when you write an SQL statement you describe what needs to be done, but not exactly how to do it -- the exact details of how the query is executed are handled internally by the RDBMS you are using.

## Metaphor: Spreadsheet as database

* Spreadsheet => Database
* Worksheet => Table
* Worksheet Column => Table Column
* Worksheet Row => Table Record
