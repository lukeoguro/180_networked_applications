# SQL Basics tutorial

## `SELECT`

* `SELECT` is a keyword used to retrieve data
* `*` is a *wild card* character that acts as an identifier for *all* columns
* `FROM` is another keyword that is used as a clause within a `SELECT` statement to identify the table
* `WHERE` clause is a conditional that is checked for each row

## Data and schema

* **Schema** is concerned with the *structure* of a database (i.e., names of tables and table columns, data types of those columns, constraints, etc)
  * Schema without data is a bunch of empty tables
* **Data** is concerned with the *contents* of a database
  * Data without schema is unstructured data
