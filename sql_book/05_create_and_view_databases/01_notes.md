# Create and view databases

## Database

* Schema is part of the database (the floor plan)
* Using DDL to create database
* `CREATE DATABASE` statement creates a database
  * Make names self-descriptive
  * Should be named in snake case
* `DROP DATABASE` can be used to delete database
* Use `\list` meta command to list databases
* Use `\connect` to connect to another database

## Tips

* SQL is not case-sensitive
* For instance, you could write `create database my_database;` which would be analogous to its capitalized counterpart
* Meta commands do not have to be terminated with a semi-colon
* Use meta command `\e` to rewrite previous statement
